# Earthquaking modelling in Indonesia using Decision Tree and Support Vector Machine

## Overview

The country of Indonesia suffers from earthquakes all over the country due to its lower sea levels and proximity to the Pacific ring of fire. This area is known to have the most tectonic plates clashing, creating earthquakes when the plates shove against each other. One of the most deadly earthquakes was the magnitude 9.1 quake that struck off the west coast of the Indonesian island of Sumatra on December 26, 2004, triggering a large tsunami.

## Objectives

The objective of our research is to predict earthquake locations and intensity in various locations across Indonesia. Our focus will be using machine learning models to analyze historical data and increase data accuracy for our earthquake modelling. The long-term goal would be to use this data in order to better prepare citizens of specific locations to have faster response times in terms of evacuation
