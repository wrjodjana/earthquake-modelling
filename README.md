# Earthquake modelling in Indonesia using Decision Tree and Support Vector Machine

## Overview
The country of Indonesia suffers from earthquakes all over the country due to its lower sea levels and proximity to the Pacific ring of fire. This area is known to have the most tectonic plates clashing, creating earthquakes when the plates shove against each other. One of the most deadly earthquakes was the magnitude 9.1 quake that struck off the west coast of the Indonesian island of Sumatra on December 26, 2004, triggering a large tsunami.

## Objectives
The objective of our research is to predict earthquake locations and intensity in various locations across Indonesia. Our focus will be using machine learning models to analyze historical data and increase data accuracy for our earthquake modelling. The long-term goal would be to use this data in order to better prepare citizens to have faster evacuation times.

## Dataset
The dataset that we're using is provided by the BKMG (Badan Meteorologi, Klimatologi, dan Geofisika), which is an Indonesian non-departmental government agency and is compiled through Kaggle. The dataset is meticulously processed to handle missing values and outliers, ensuring its suitability for training and evaluating the models.

## Methods

Classification Algorithms Two prominent machine learning algorithms, Decision Trees and Support Vector Machine (SVM), are employed to build predictive models for earthquakes. These algorithms are chosen for their effectiveness in handling complex datasets and their potential to reveal patterns in earthquakes location and intensity

## Model Evaluation

Grid search Cross-Validation (Grid search CV) is employed to fine-tune the models and identify optimal parameters. The goal is to enhance the accuracy of the models in predicting the location and intensity of earthquakes.
