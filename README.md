# Earthquaking modelling in Indonesia using Decision Tree and Support Vector Machine

## Overview

The country of Indonesia suffers from earthquakes all over the country due to its lower sea levels and proximity to the Pacific ring of fire. This area is known to have the most tectonic plates clashing, creating earthquakes when the plates shove against each other. One of the most deadly earthquakes was the magnitude 9.1 quake that struck off the west coast of the Indonesian island of Sumatra on December 26, 2004, triggering a large tsunami
